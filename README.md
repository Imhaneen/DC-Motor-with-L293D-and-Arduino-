# Two DC motor with L293D and Arduino 
******

### About this project 
*****
The project is simply about controlling the direction of two DC motors with simple digital signals by using L293D with Arduino.

****

### Overview of the L293D Motor Driver
*****
The L293D is an H-bridge motor driver integrated circuit used to control DC motors and stepper motors. It allows the direction and speed of motors 
to be controlled using digital signals from a microcontroller such as Arduino. One of the advantages of the L293D is that it can drive two DC motors independently.
